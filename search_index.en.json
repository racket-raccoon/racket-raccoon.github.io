your first post, you're expected to uncover the motivation behind this whole project and justify its very existence. I'll give it a try — but I won't try too hard, that's for sure.\n\nIt's January 2025, and I feel like this year's Advent of Code was the last straw. I realized that as I'm learning new things, I need to write them down. Doing AoC in Racket and hanging out in the Racket Discord server made me realize that maybe I want to commit a tiny bit more: use Racket more for my day-to-day tasks and hobby projects, read to cover my knowledge gaps, and dig deeper into other cool Lisps, such as Guile Hoot for HTML5 games and Janet as a nice embeddable language.\nI've been a C++ guy since university. C++ is still there and isn't going anywhere; it pays my bills duly. But, as you might have guessed, I need a breath of fresh air. Rust is usually the next logical step for someone like me, as it solves a lot of C++ issues and has created this whole cult culture around the language. I tried it. I can't really complain — it just doesn't feel fun. And if it doesn't, I don't want to do it for free.\nUpd: Right after I wrote this down I bumped into an interview with Mitchell Hashimoto, co-founder of HashiCorp and a mind behind Ghostty, where he uses almost the same exact words justifying Zig choice over Rust.\n\nWhen I write and read Rust I'm not having fun and I want to have fun\n\n\n... A part of the joy is writing the code\n\nProgramming is (should be) fun! Sussman\nLisp just does it for me, and I'm not even good at it. Every time I read the first chapters of SICP, those words hit the target every time. Words about legendary \"Lisp wizards\", \"spirits of the computer\" obeying our powerful \"spells\". And, of course, this famous quote by Alan J. Perlis:\n\nI think that it’s extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while, we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free, perfect use of these machines. I don’t think we are. I think we’re responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don’t become missionaries. Don’t feel as if you’re Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing, other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.\n\nThis blog doesn't compete, nor does it try to compete, with amazing Beautiful Racket explainers, but the idea is somewhat similar.

Oh no"},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/json-dsl/":{"body":"What started as a simple fitness data export turned into a perfect illustration of why domain-specific languages can be so powerful.\nA brief journey from Racket to jsonquerylang.\n\nRecently, I needed to extract my step data collected by my watch from the Garmin website and put it into a spreadsheet.\nI decided this would be a good opportunity to solve the problem with a little Racket script.\nFortunately, the web developer tools in my browser were able to extract the step data in JSON format.\nThe file format looks something like this:\n\nI only needed dates and step counts, and I was specifically interested in dates starting from January 14.\nWhile the entries appeared to be sorted already, I decided to apply sorting just to be safe.\nAfter processing, I wanted to save the steps into a CSV file that could be easily imported by any spreadsheet software.\nMy first attempt looked something like this:\n\nUsing call-with-input-file and call-with-output-file instead of working with file ports directly helps us to close those ports automatically as soon as we're done with our I/O operations.\nThe read-json function is defined in the json library, which is part of the base package and available out of the box.\nThe parsed output looks like this:\n\nA JSON object is represented with hasheq using symbols as keys, while a JSON array becomes a list.\nFortunately, the dates are formatted as YYYY-MM-DD, meaning that regular lexicographical sorting will also maintain chronological order.\nFinally, we form a comma-separated string and write it to a file using the display function.\nThe #:exists flag specifies how to handle situations when the output file already exists.\nBy default, an exception would be thrown, so it's easier to just silently override the file each time.\nI was working on this small exercise while hanging out on Janet's stream (amazing Clojure developer) when someone in the chat mentioned jsonquerylang - a very cute and impressive DSL for JSON processing.\nAnd what's a Racket blog without a DSL discussion? Just look at how cleanly the exact same idea can be expressed in this language:\n\nThere's a live playground at https://jsonquerylang.org/ where you can simply paste your JSON into the \"Input\" text area and edit the query line by line, seeing the query result updated live in the output field.\nYou can tell how well this small language is designed by how quickly I was able to write this query without any prior experience, guided only by examples and quick reference.\nThis example perfectly illustrates how powerful domain-specific languages can be as tools - it's a perfect illustration of the phrase \"right tool for the job\".\nA good DSL provides you with the right mental model and the right \"angle of attack\" for the problem you're trying to solve.\n","id":"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/json-dsl/","title":"When DSLs Shine: Processing JSON in Racket and Beyond"},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/leetcode-backspace-string/":{"body":"I'm gonna try to trick my brain into doing some leetcode challenges over the course of this year, so let's start with something simple like \"Backspace String Compare\".\n\nFirst thing that comes to mind is to build two normalised strings separately and then just compare those with equal?.\nEvery non-backspace character is pushed into a stack-like buffer and for every # we pop one of those out - clean and simple.\n\nUnfortunately, we can't call it a day yet; now we have to talk about complexity, and I always have a hard time analysing those.\nTime-wise, we have to iterate over both strings once to build their normalised representation.\nMeaning, if the size of s is A and the size of t is B, then we'll have to go through A + B elements just to build those.\nequal? is basically a loop that is going to iterate through the resulting strings: worst-case scenario would be if (length (build s)) == A and (length (build t)) == B, meaning that iteration goes up to (min A B).\nProbably worth noting that we could speed up this check by keeping track of the stack buffer size e.g. increment on push and decrement on pop.\nThis way we could compare their sizes and fail fast if they aren't the same; doesn't affect the worst-case scenario so doesn't change our complexity analysis.\nThat means that time complexity would be either O(2A+B) or O(A+2B), smart people would just wave their hands and say that it's the same as O(A+B) as 2A is linearly proportional to A so we don't really care about constant multipliers.\nWe can even simply say that it's O(N) implying N = A + B as a good generalisation.\nObviously, this challenge is all about space complexity so let's estimate it: we allocate two additional lists to store normalised strings.\nMaking the same point about the worst-case scenario and string sizes, it's clear that space complexity is O(A+B) or O(N) and it can be improved upon.\nWe would like to avoid creating those buffers altogether, pursuing space complexity of O(1), and apparently the trick is to iterate the strings in reverse.\nGoing from right to left, we need two pointers to iterate both strings in parallel.\nI'm gonna use those little closures to achieve that:\n\nEvery time we meet # we have to increment the skips count and we can only return the next character if skips count is zero.\nNot only do we avoid allocating unnecessary buffers, but we also fail fast as iteration stops as soon as we find a difference between those sequences.\nI foolishly used null instead of 'end when I wrote it first and fell head on into a trap related to the way match works.\nMatching a two-element list against (list null null) apparently might not perform as you would expect and both Claude and ChatGPT initially don't seem to be aware of that either.\nYou should think about null in Racket as a regular identifier like (define null '()) rather than some magic literal.\nHere is how ChatGPT describes it if you turn on the \"deep research\" mode for the request \"evaluate this racket expression (match (list #\\p #\\p) [(list null null) #t] [else #f])\":\n\nSince the first pattern matches (list #\\p #\\p), the overall expression returns #t. In summary, (match (list #\\p #\\p) [(list null null) #t] [else #f]) evaluates to #t because null in the pattern is a wildcard variable (not the empty-list), and the two characters are equal so the match succeeds\n\nVery last point I wanted to make is related to functions like next that have an internal state and return the next value in a sequence every time you call them.\nThere is a nice convenience function in-producer that creates a wrapper around such functions and allows you to iterate through those sequences with a regular for loop.\nHere is an example of how you could write an adapter for the next function to make it return a list straight away - very similar to what the build function did for us:\n\n","id":"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/leetcode-backspace-string/","title":"Leetcode #844: Backspace String Compare"},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/memoization/":{"body":"Anyways, function memoization, amiright? \"Top-down\" dynamic programming. Before attempting to calculate the function result for a particular set of parameters, we look up the table first to avoid doing the same work twice.\n\nSuper useful in many situations, especially when we want to speed up an intuitive but inefficient recursive solution without re-writing it into an iterative \"bottom-up\" one. A quick google shows that there are a couple of libraries that can do the heavy lifting for us, e.g., the memo package. Here is an example provided in the docs:\n\nThat should work fine for most situations; however, define/memoize by default uses eq? instead of equal? to compare cache keys, which might become an unpleasant surprise for you.\n\nThis package provides macros for defining memoized functions. A memoized function stores its results in a hasheq table.\n\n\nThe hash procedure creates a table where keys are compared with equal?, hashalw creates a table where keys are compared with equal-always?, hasheq procedure creates a table where keys are compared with eq?, hasheqv procedure creates a table where keys are compared with eqv?.\n\nThis is not the end of the world, of course. As the documentation says, the #:hash parameter specifies a hash table to use for the memoized data, and accessing the cache is done by calling the function without any arguments. Here is a quick demo:\n\n\nJust to have another tool in your Racket toolbox, here is how to write the simplest memoizer from scratch. Following the implementation given in \"Racket Programming the Fun Way\", we would write something like this:\n\nThat's a neat way of creating a closure. First, we always check for the base case, then we look up the table and return early if the result is already there. Otherwise, we perform the computation and save the value into the table. The only annoying thing here (probably coming from my C++ background) is the classic double lookup pitfall, one of the reasons why std::map didn't even have a contains method until C++20. Not sure what would be the cleanest way to avoid double lookup in this case, but I opt for something like this:\n\n","id":"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/memoization/","title":"Memoization: A Primer"},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/named-let/":{"body":"A quick introduction to the named let, why you might want to use letrec, and what \"mutually recursive functions\" are. To learn more about the let family, consult The Racket Guide and The Racket Reference.\n\nThe syntax of named let initially felt alien to me, requiring multiple visits to the reference page, but it's actually quite simple. Named let is syntactic sugar that allows us to write a function and immediately call it in-place — perfect for recursion and basic while loops. Let's examine the classic SICP factorial example:\n\nThe only modification here is that instead of explicitly calling fact-iter as (fact-iter 1 1 n), we've made those arguments optional by providing default values. This makes it look very similar to the named let syntax:\n\nSome programmers prefer using let over define for local bindings, even without a compelling reason — it's often considered a matter of style. However, the general rule is to reduce code indentation when possible and use define unless you need let-specific features. The Racket refactoring tool resyntax can automatically refactor unnecessary let expressions, as shown in its very first documentation example.\nNotably, attempting to rewrite the first example with raw let and lambda fails because the identifier created by a regular let can't be recursive. fact-iter isn't available in the lambda body — you must use letrec:\n\nWhile let* only allows using identifiers from previous [] clauses, letrec enables both recursive use of an identifier and referencing identifiers from previous and subsequent clauses, enabling mutually recursive functions. A classic example is the is-even? and is-odd? functions defined in terms of each other. Let's use the racket/trace package to visualize the call stack — a valuable debugging tool, particularly for recursive calls:\n\n\nNow you can see these functions playing ping-pong, calling each other until reaching a base case. Finally, here's the same example rewritten using letrec, which allows mutual recursion even though is-odd? is referenced before being defined:\n\n","id":"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/named-let/","title":"Named Let and Mutual Recursion"},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/podcasts/":{"body":"Dive into the lore of Scheme and Racket with these awesome podcast episodes – where coding stories and functional wisdom come to life.\nI've hand-picked each one to create the ultimate listening guide for Lisp enthusiasts.\n\n\nI've deliberately chosen not to include Clojure-specific content, as there's so much of it out there that it would easily take over the page.

Also, I wanted to give an honorable mention to some higher-order functions we have out of the box from Racket.\n\n\nNOTE The word \"thread\" in this context means passing a value through a pipeline of functions and has nothing to do with concurrent threads of execution.\n\nTLDR; It's just syntactic sugar to flatten nested function calls for readability. With this macro, you can rewrite (add1 (exact-floor (log num 10))) as (~&gt; num (log 10) exact-floor add1).\nI first bumped into this concept while doing some Clojure coding challenges on Exercism. Those macros are part of the core Clojure language, so you don't need to install any libraries. In Racket, unfortunately, you have to install the threading-lib package first, e.g. raco pkg install threading. That actually was one of the reasons why I hadn't used it for a long time, just tried to avoid third-party packages as much as possible.\nFirst of all, the package documentation is extremely well written, so please just check it out. Here is one more quick example to give you a taste of it. In functional programming, we often push our data through a pipeline of functions, transforming it step-by-step to get the desired result. Here is one of the countless ways to transform a string into its acronym; comments show the state of the data at every pipeline stage going left to right:\n\nNow let's take a step back and talk about some tools Racket gives us out of the box to combine functions together. The function provided in TLDR uses some arithmetic operations to calculate the number of digits in a given number. We could use compose or compose1 functions here to combine those building blocks together. Let's note some of the differences between those two approaches:\n\nNot only does compose apply those functions in reverse order, but we also had to use curryr to provide an adapter for the log function - if you're unfamiliar using curryr here is basically equivalent to (λ (x) (log x 10)). The threading macro will always try to plug the value into the first parameter hole but also provides that magic _ that allows you to specify where to put it, as we did in the line (map (curryr string-ref 0) _) ; '(#\\C #\\M #\\O #\\S) of our acronym example. λ~&gt; or lambda~&gt; here demonstrates how we can obtain a function that represents the pipeline to pass it into another higher-order function, e.g. map or filter.\nA lot of those functions could save you from writing yet another lambda or currying a function. I want to finish this text by mentioning a couple of functions provided by racket/function and racket but not racket/base. Let's give an honorable mention to the identity function, which is surprisingly useful for a function that just returns back whatever you passed in. Here is a simplified example from SICP - functions sum-cubes and sum-integers are implemented in terms of a higher-order sum function:\n\nAs a bonus, identity could be used to filter/count all the non-#f elements of the list:\n\nSometimes we need to combine predicates in place during filtering - conjoin, disjoin, and negate are for the rescue. We can express \"give me a function that checks if a given value satisfies ALL of those predicates\" as (conjoin pred1? pred2? pred3?). Similarly, you can ask if a value satisfies AT LEAST one of the given predicates with (disjoin pred1? pred2? pred3?). In this example, we have a two-dimensional grid map like in a classic rogue, #\\. is a walkable floor tile while #\\# is a wall that blocks the way. Combining in-bounds? and is-wall? together with conjoin and negate allows us to get a list of all available steps from a given tile.\n\n","id":"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/threading/","title":"Threading and Function Composition"}},"docInfo":{"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/":{"body":0,"title":0},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/but-why/":{"body":342,"title":4},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/json-dsl/":{"body":268,"title":6},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/leetcode-backspace-string/":{"body":388,"title":5},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/memoization/":{"body":205,"title":2},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/named-let/":{"body":207,"title":3},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/podcasts/":{"body":296,"title":5},"https://racket-raccoon.github.io/threading/":{"body":368,"title":3}},"length":8},"lang":"English"}
